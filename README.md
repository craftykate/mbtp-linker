# Easy MBTP Linker

Easy way to open MBTP links, plus some common and helpful links

## Introduction

Typing out the whole link every time we need to watch a video or open a game is annoying. Even tabbing through the autocomplete in the url bar is frustrating. Since just the last part of the url changes I thought it would be nice to have a little utility for easily opening the links.

And because I don't like finding the Learning Gates quiz site several times a week (or leaving the tab open all the time) I decided to link to the quiz site and the online curriculum area. From one site you can easily open today's mbtp link, launch the quiz, and open the online curriculum area in case you need to print something out.

I also added links to a couple of my education apps at the bottom - the site I built for practicing phone numbers and the site I built for practicing sorting numbers. I may add more helpful links to the bottom from other sources as well.

## Usage

Simple! Open https://mbtp-linker.vercel.app and type in the number part of your mbtp link. Or choose from the links on the page to open.
